# Mobile_IoT_App

This is a project for purposes of college IoT course, which me and my friends [Krzysiek](https://github.com/CleverLord) and [Janek](https://github.com/Laronk) realized during our 5th study semester.

This project involved developing an application to manage smart sensors and monitor data readings. 
Our team used a range of technologies including:
- C#,
- Arduino,
- Flutter,
- MQTT (mosquitto) broker hosted on Raspberry Pi,
- ESP8266 as microcontrollers.

As the developer, I was responsible for implementing the web API in ASP.NET Core.

Through this project, I gained valuable experience in project management, software development and IoT technologies.
